# ARToolKit_solution

This is the ARToolKit_Package for Zuokun's Intern at e-Content Store.

It contains the ARTKTest_Version.unitypackage, the ARToolKit_Final_Version.unitypackage and the WebGL_Helpe_Tool.unitypackage.

The ARTKTest_Version is usable for testing the AR utilities by changing the Marker tag and the NFT dataset name.

The ARToolKit_Final_Version is the one that is finally implemented into the whole project.

The WebGL_Helpe_Tool is the provided to our users for creating and generating their own dataset files.
